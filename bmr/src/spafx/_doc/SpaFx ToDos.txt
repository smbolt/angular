This document provides reminders of things that need to be changed in order
for the SpaFx framework to be as generic as possible.

1. In spafx-sign-in.component.html, the img src value is hard-coded and needs to be supplied
   via configuration.  The same goes for the background image in spafx-sign-in.component.css.
   Use the SpaFxConfigService object in spafx-config.service.ts to provide configurations.
   The configuration settings can be accessed in the OnInit code of the SpaFxSignInComponent
   or in the view (html).
   
2. The SpaFxConfigService should eventually have data driven properties and not provide its
   values via hard-coding.

3. Related to item 1 above, the same goes for the SpaFxRegisterUser component.  There are hard-coded
   file references in the SpaFx framework - should be provided by the config service.
